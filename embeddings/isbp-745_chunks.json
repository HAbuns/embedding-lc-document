  "2 \n PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS  \nISBP - Paragraph 1 to 7  \nScope of the publication  \ni) This publication is to be read in conjunction with UCP600 and not in isolation.  \nii) The practices described in this publication highlight how the articles of UCP600 are to be interpreted \nand applied, to the extent that the terms and conditions of the credit, or any amendment thereto, do not \nexpressly modify or exclude an applicable article in UCP600.",
  "modify or exclude an applicable article in UCP600.  \nThe credit and amendment application, the issuance of the credit and any amend ment thereto  \niii) The terms and conditions of a credit and any amendment thereto are independent of the underlying \nsale or other contract even if the credit or amendment expressly refers to that sale or other contract.",
  "t expressly refers to that sale or other contract. \nWhen agreeing the terms of the sale o r other contract, the parties thereto should be aware of the ensuing \nimplications for the completion of the credit or amendment application.  \niv) Many of the problems that arise at the document examination stage could be avoided or resolved by \nthe respectiv e parties through careful attention to detail in the credit or amendment application and \nissuance of the credit or any amendment thereto.",
  "issuance of the credit or any amendment thereto. The applicant and beneficiary should carefully consider \nthe documents required for presentation, by whom they are to b e issued, their data content and the time \nframe in which they are to be presented.  \nv) The applicant bears the risk of any ambiguity in its instructions to issue or amend a credit.",
  "ty in its instructions to issue or amend a credit. An issuing \nbank may, unless the applicant expressly instructs to the contrar y, supplement or develop those \ninstructions in a manner necessary or desirable to permit the use of the credit or any amendment thereto. \nAn issuing bank should ensure that any credit or amendment it issues is not ambiguous or conflicting in \nits terms and c onditions.",
  "uous or conflicting in \nits terms and c onditions.  \nvi) The applicant and issuing bank should be fully aware of the content of UCP600 and recognize that \narticles such as 3, 14, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 28 (i), 30 and 31 define terms in a manner that may produce \nunexpected results.",
  "in a manner that may produce \nunexpected results. For example, a credi t requiring presentation of a bill of lading and containing a \nprohibition against transshipment  will, in most cases, have to exclude UCP600 sub -article 20 (c) to make \nthe prohibition against transshipment  effective.  \nvii) A credit or any amendment thereto s hould not require presentation of a document that is to be issued, \nsigned or countersigned by the applicant.",
  "issued, \nsigned or countersigned by the applicant. If, nevertheless, a credit or amendment is issued including such \na requirement, the beneficiary should consider the appropriateness of such a requi rement and determine \nits ability to comply with it, or seek a suitable amendment.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n 1.

  "cuments in substitution for a word or v ice versa. A credit that includes an abbreviation in its text allows \na document to show the same abbreviation or any other abbreviation that has the same meaning, or to \nshow the complete spelling of the word or vice versa.  \nA2) a. Virgules (i.e., slash marks \"/\") may result in different meanings and should not be used as a \nsubstitute for a word. If, nevertheless, a virgule is used and no context is apparent, this will allow the use \nof one or more of the options.",
  "will allow the use \nof one or more of the options. For example, a cond ition in a credit stating \"Red/Black/Blue\" with no \nfurther clarification will mean only Red or only Black or only Blue or any combination of them.  \nb. The use of a comma when indicating a range of data in a credit such as ports of loading or discharge \nor co untries of origin, may result in different meanings and should not be used as a substitute for a \nword.",
  "nd should not be used as a substitute for a \nword. If, nevertheless, a comma is used and no context is apparent, this will allow the use of one or \nmore of the options. For example, when a credit allows pa rtial shipment and indicates the port of \nloading information as \"Hamburg, Rotterdam, Antwerp\" with no further clarification, this will mean \nonly Hamburg or only Rotterdam or only Antwerp or any combination of them.",
  "terdam or only Antwerp or any combination of them.  \n Certificates, Certifications, Declaratio ns and Statements  \nA3) When a certificate, certification, declaration or statement is required by a credit, it is to be signed.  \nA4) Whether  a certificate, certification, declaration or statement needs to be dated will depend on the \ntype of certificate, certification, declaration or statement that has been requested, its required wording \nand the wording that appears within the document.",

For example, when a document issued by XXX shows three corrections numbered 1, 2 \nand 3, one statement such as \"Correction numbers 1, 2 and 3 authenticated by XXX\" or similar, together \nwith the signature or initials of XXX, will sa tisfy the requirement for authentication.  \nA9) The use of multiple type styles, font sizes or handwriting within the same document does not, by \nitself, signify a correction.",
