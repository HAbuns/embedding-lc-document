It is the fruit of more than three y ears of work by the International \nChamber of Commerce's (ICC) Commission on Banking Technique and Practice.",
  "ICC) Commission on Banking Technique and Practice.  \nICC, which was established in 1919, had as  its primary objecti ve facilitating the \nflow of international trade at a time when nationalism and protectionism posed serious \nthreats to the world trading system. It was in that spirit that the UCP were first introduced - to alleviate the confusion caused by indi vidual countries' promoting their own national \nrules on letter of credit practice.",
  "own national \nrules on letter of credit practice. The objecti ve, since attained, was to create a set of \ncontractual rules that would establish uniformi ty in that practice, so that practitioners \nwould not have to cope with a plethora of often conflicting national regulations. The \nuniversal acceptance of the UCP by practitioners in count ries with widely divergent \neconomic and judicial syst ems is a testament to the rules' success.",
  "ial syst ems is a testament to the rules' success.  \nIt is important to recall that the UCP repr esent the work of a private international \norganization, not a governmental body. Since its inception, ICC has insisted on the central role of self-regulati on in business practice. These rules, formulated entirely by \nexperts in the private sector, have validated that approach.  The UCP remain the most \nsuccessful set of private rule s for trade ever developed.",
  "ul set of private rule s for trade ever developed.  \nA range of individuals and groups contribut ed to the current revision, which is \nentitled UCP 600. These incl ude the UCP Drafting Group, which sifted through more \nthan 5000 individual comments before arri ving at this consensus text; the UCP \nConsulting Group, consisting of members from more than 25 countries, which served as \nthe advisory body reacting to and proposing c hanges to the various drafts; the more \nthan 400 members of the I CC Commission o",
  "he more \nthan 400 members of the I CC Commission on Banking Technique and Practice who \nmade pertinent suggestions for changes in  the text; and ICC national committees \nworldwide which took an active role in cons olidating comments from  their members. ICC \nalso expresses its gratitude to practitioners in the transport and insurance industries, whose perceptive suggestions  honed the final draft.",
  "ose perceptive suggestions  honed the final draft.  \nGuy Sebban  \nSecretary General  \nInternational Chamber of Commerce  \n   \nINTRODUCTION \n \nIn May 2003, the International Cham ber of Commerce authorized the ICC \nCommission on Banking Technique and Prac tice (Banking Commission) to begin a \nrevision of the Uniform Cust oms and Practice for Document ary Credits, ICC Publication \n500.",
  "ce for Document ary Credits, ICC Publication \n500.  \nAs with other revisions, the general objec tive was to address developments in the \nbanking, transport and insurance i ndustries. Additionally, there was a need to look at the \nlanguage and style used in the UCP to remove wording that could lead to inconsistent \napplication and interpretation.",
  "d to inconsistent \napplication and interpretation.  \n \nThöông maïi Vieät Nam \n 2 When work on the revision started, a num ber of global surveys indicated that, \nbecause of discrepancies, approximately 70% of documents presented under letters of \ncredit were being rejected on first presentation.",
  "credit were being rejected on first presentation. This obviously had, and continues to have, a negative effect on the letter of credit being seen as a means of payment and, if \nunchecked, could have serious implications for maintaining or increasing its market share as a recognized means of settlement in  international trade. The introduction by \nbanks of a discrepancy fee has highlighted the impor tance of this issue, especially when \nthe underlying discrepancies have been found to be dubiou s or unsound.",
  "pancies have been found to be dubiou s or unsound. Whilst the \nnumber of cases involving liti gation has not grown during t he lifetime of UCP 500, the \nintroduction of the ICC's Documentary Credit Dispute Resolution Expertise Rules \n(DOCDEX) in October 1997 (subsequently revis ed in March 2002) has resulted in more \nthan 60 cases being decided.  \nTo address these and other concerns, the Banking Commission established a \nDrafting Group to revise UCP 500.",
  "n established a \nDrafting Group to revise UCP 500. It was also decided to create a second group, known \nas the Consulting Group, to review and advise on early drafts submitted by the Drafting \nGroup. The Consulting Group, made up of over  40 individuals from 26 countries, \nconsisted of banking and transpor t industry experts.",
  "sisted of banking and transpor t industry experts. Ably co-chaired by John Turnbull, \nDeputy General Manager, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation Europe Ltd, London \nand Carlo Di Ninni, Adviser, Italian Bankers Association, Rome, the Consulting Group \nprovided valuable input to t he Drafting Group prior to rel ease of draft texts to ICC \nnational committees.  \nThe Drafting Group began the review proce ss by analyzing the content of the \nofficial Opinions issued by the Bankin g Commission under UCP 500.",
  "s issued by the Bankin g Commission under UCP 500. Some 500 \nOpinions were reviewed to assess whether t he issues involved warranted a change in, \nan addition to or a deletion of  any UCP article. In addition,  consideration was given to \nthe content of the four Po sition Papers issued by the Co mmission in September 1994, \nthe two Decisions issued by the Commissi on (concerning the introduction of the euro \nand the determination of what constitut ed an original document under UCP 500 sub-\narticle 20(b) and",

  "of documents with the terms of letters  of credit. It is the expectation of the \nDrafting Group and the Banking Commission t hat the application of the principles \ncontained in the ISBP, incl uding subsequent revisions t hereof, will continue during the \ntime UCP 600 is in force. At the time UCP  600 is implemented, t here will be an updated \nversion of the ISBP to bring its contents in  line with the substance and style of the new \nrules.",
  "ne with the substance and style of the new \nrules.  \nThe four Position Papers issued in Sept ember 1994 were issued subject to their \napplication under UCP 500; therefore, they will not be applicable  under UCP 600. The \nessence of the Decision covering the determination of an original document has been incorporated into the text of UCP 600.",
  "nt has been incorporated into the text of UCP 600.  The outcome of the DOCDEX cases were \ninvariably based on existing ICC Banking Co mmission Opinions and therefore contained \nno specific issues that requir ed addressing in these rules.  \nOne of the structural changes to the UCP is the introduction of articles covering \ndefinitions (article 2) and interpretations (article  3).",
  "ions (article 2) and interpretations (article  3). In providing definitions of roles played \nby banks and the meaning of sp ecific terms and events, UCP 600 avoids the necessity \n \nThöông maïi Vieät Nam \n 3of repetitive text to explain their interpretation and applicat ion. Similarly, the article \ncovering interpretations aims to take the am biguity out of vague or unclear language that \nappears in letters of credit and to provide a defi nitive elucidation of other characteristics \nof the UCP or the credit.",
